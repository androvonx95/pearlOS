# Configuration Guide

PearlOS prides itself in its configuration. It is incredibly easy to use and create
new configurations with! Follow this quick tutorial to learn how to make your own!

## Tutorial

To start, create a new folder in the "profiles" directory, like this:
```console
mkdir ./profiles/<dir>
```
Enter the directory. PearlOS uses one config file, it is:

- `config.h`   : Main kernel config.

Let's begin! Create a new file called "config.h", like this:


```console
touch config.h
```

Open it using your favourite editor, and let's get configuring! This configuration
operates using macros, refer to this table when defining them:


```
DEFAULT_THEME<macro>             : Refer to your favourite colourscheme
                                   defined in drivers/display_color.h.

KERNEL_STARTUP<function>         : Entry point for kernel, pick one or
                                   maybe add your own?

KERNEL_UPDATE<null>              : Infinity macro, the main kernel part
                                   (kernel/kernel.c) needs this one.

KSH_PROMPT<char*>                : The prompt that shows up when writing
                                   commands in the Kernel SHell.

KSH_PROMPT2<char*>               : The prompt that shows up when extra input
                                   is required.

KSH_COMMENT<char>                : The character that is required to
                                   start a comment line.

KERNEL_MEMORY_OFFSET_{START,
                      END}<byte> : Kernel memory offsets,
                                   defaults are "0x{f*x}".

MEMORY_INDEX_BASE_SIZE           : Basically how many calls of the
                                   allocator (kmalloc) you can do.
```

So, a good configuration might be:

```c
#pragma once

#define DEFAULT_THEME  WHITE_ON_BLUE
#define KERNEL_STARTUP ksh_start();
#define KERNEL_UPDATE

#define KSH_PROMPT  "pearl>"
#define KSH_COMMENT '#'

#define KERNEL_MEMORY_OFFSET_START 0xffffff
#define KERNEL_MEMORY_OFFSET_END   0xffffffff
#define MEMORY_INDEX_BASE_SIZE     100
```

Finally, navigate into the root of this repository
and run:

```console
./configure <profile-name>
```
