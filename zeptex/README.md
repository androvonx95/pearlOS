### Zeptex

*"Added Zeptex, a no-frills line-based text editor for the kernel shell. You can add,
edit, insert, delete lines, clear the buffer, and save files. Keeps things super
simple and easy on memory"* - androvonx95

Zeptex is a WIP text editor written by @androvonx95. It is planned to be added soon
after a little development so that it works.

(The most up-to-date version of Zeptex is found at 
[androvonx95's github repository](https://github.com/androvonx95/Zeptex)
by the same name, as this is just a downstream version.)
